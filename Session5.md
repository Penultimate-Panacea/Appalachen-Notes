We take a long rest and gained the standard adventuring equipment from the safe house. We head off to the mines , the area is strangely quiet and unnerving. There is a warehouse on the left and two mine entrances on the right. 

The study of faries and feys in this world is very vauge and storybook. You only get flowery descriptions. There are three houses of the fey, Time, Light, and Darkness. The house of Time, house of Light, and house of Darkness.

All are entangled in a conflict with each other. The fey are connected with magic and arcana and creatures of the earth. The study is "Are the Fey intrinsicly magical just like we were?" The University was very interested in "What is Magic?". 

They each have internal moralities, but do not deal with human moralities. They are not amoral.  Historical knowledge is reliable in most cases but modern knowledge of the fey is treated like alien abduction stories. 

There are several different schools of thoughts on where magic comes from. The strongest is bloodlines. There is also a sense that people are touched by the fey in some way, that they have some kind of fey bloodline in them. The other is that Magic at its heart is a human construct like technology and the fey use magic totally different. 

Leroy's axe seems to connect Leroy to the House of Light.  

Meemaw moved to Slimy Pebble to be closer to the fey in some way.

We searched the mine's warehouses and utilized Hayes familiar to scout the mine to confirm that there was no one left in it. 

We then head to Worthington and Hayes' familiar also notices the black puffs moving through the forest. Ms. D'Arcy becomes tired in the forest during the travel and Leroy decides to give them an indigiant piggy back ride.


Arriving in Worthington the town is fully deserted. The last train arrived three weeks ago. Inside Crickside Mushrooms the same symbol on the blood wall and people eater portals. There is an arrow in the middle of the symbol pointing downwards. Scoria heads down the ladder and finds a room with three branching paths, the room is illuminated by torches (likely magical). Scoria heads deeper down into the ground and hears a wooshing to the left. Little bits of air woosh past Scoria at various points. Scoria follows the wooshing and the air and arrives at a room with a purple-shimmery magical surface. This is beneath the portal on the surface of this town and is likely the sides of the portal going deep into the ground.

Leroy sticks his hand in after some expirements with a stick, and gets a dart embedded in his hand. Leroy sticks his head in the portal and sees a huge tunnel lit in dark purple with crystals jagged on all sides. There are two small men with pickaxes and lamp mining helments in this tunnel. They are surprised by the head and throw a dart at his face and hit. He pops head out to inform the rest of the small party in the mushrooming caves and sticks his head back in. The two small persons insist that they are fine and don't need help and continue to throw darts at Leroy. Leroy jumps down the hole and hits the ground which crumples underneath him. Leroy casts *Cure Wounds* on one of the small men who had accidentally darted himself in the need to chase Leroy away. A green burst of dust comes out of his fingers as all in hole jump in surprise. The pickaxe is less of a pickaxe than a shovel with a few prongs. The small men (around 5') are wearing quite smart three piece suits insist that they are in Worthington and work for the mushroom gathering people. 

**Leroy decides to lie.** "We both actually work for USIron, right?" The small man is deeply surprised and points out that they do not work for USIron but instead insist that they are gathering mushrooms. There are no mushrooms in this area. Then the five foot folk brandish  a knife and try to chase Leroy up the rope. Leroy takes out his axe and they drop the knife. The folk work for Banana King (a downtown purveyor of fine fruits), their names are Marcellio and Aurelio. They insist that the leader of USIron are Carnegie and Frick, the most powerful men in the world.

They recieved a letter from the boss with a skull on it telling them to go to 801 Wiley Ave. They trekked out here and claim that someone stole the train. They took donkeys from Steel City to Worthington. Someone told them to go down the hole and mine blue crystals. Gannister pulls a massive crystal out of the wall and asks Leroy to come out of the hole. Leroy moves to leave the hole and Aurelio goes to try and grab him. Leroy turns the axe around puts it right through his entire head. Marcelio starts to scream and panic. Leroy says, "My bad" and climbs out of the hole. 

Leroy has killed his first person-person and feels fine about it, thinking it was for the greater good. Gannister shakes and shudders and mutters under his breath, "Dear God Leroy". Scoria dashes away  as Leroy comes out of the hole.
