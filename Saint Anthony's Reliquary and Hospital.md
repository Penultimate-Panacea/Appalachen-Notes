Large cathedral like building made of sandstone in Polish Hill. 
Big crowd of people trying to get in, all sorts of languages from Russian to South American ones.  

Father Mollinger is very much in charge and is a faith healer. He has travelled extensively, especially South America to gather the relics. There are mixed reviews of his behavior.
