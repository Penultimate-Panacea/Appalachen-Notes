## Flashback

At 16 he was practicing with Gannister, how to play the banjo, which was a birthday gift from MeeMaw. The banjo is clearly imported and of high quality. They are practicing for a midsommer festival to win a competetion to win a magical gourd. He is a newsie, looks like Jeremy Jordan, with a luck bowtie. Took his banjo with him as his date to this festival, corsage and all. However, he has a childhood bully in the form of, Jeffery with lucious blond hair, tends towards being rail thin. 
He plays a harp while wearing a blue velvet coat, the piece is so beautiful that even Leroy tears up. Leroy cannot be angry with Jeffery given the quality of the piece. Ayamar messages Leroy encourage as Gannister shouts nonsensical but true things. He begins to play a song about a boy being lost in the woods and finding family and home elsewhere. While initially clunky, the song picks up steam as muscle memory engages. Most of the town begins a folk dance, espeically all of the old and young who have been listening to Leroy's prorgression with the banjo for the last several months. 
The mayor's age and despair seems to disappear for a bit, and hands Leroy the warty but oh so shiny Golden Gourd. Meemaw gives Leroy a big hug as he tells her that he did good. Meemaw ensures that Leroy recognizes that his energy and liveliness is no longer all his own, and he has a responsibility to the town to bring that energy and liveliness to those around him.
