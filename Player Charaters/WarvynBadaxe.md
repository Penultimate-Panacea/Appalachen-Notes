# Hill Dwarf Blood Hunter

From the woods outside of [Slimy Pebble](SlimyPebble)

Long dark hair with streaks of grey, doesn't get along well with people just doesn't trust them. More anxious than mean. 

Taught [Leroy](LeroyJenkins) how to fight with an axe views Leroy as a bit more of a pet and special situation. 

Thinking is for other people. What you do is what counts. 

Has a family but doesn't know where they are, member of the [Badaxe Clan](BadaxeClan.md) and a big fan of them. 
Used to be a quality control dwarf for the [Potion Brewing Assocation](PBA.md) as a test subject. Wanted to go to the [Adventuring Academy](AdventuringAcademy.md) and used the skills learned there to become a Blood Hunter.
