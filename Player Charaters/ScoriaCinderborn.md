## Flashback

Scoria is spying upon the Mayor in the early morning. Buzzing around town there is rumors of a formal seperation between the Mayor and his wife at this point, it is known that she has left. The Mayor is sleeping in his office at this point, so Scoria finds a tree to perch in so she can listen in to any conversation in the office. 

At this age, Scoria has no specific agenda other than wanting to find dirt on or weaknesses of the Mayor or the masters of the mine. The Mayor is being derisive of the purpose of the village and wants the village to just leave this place. He seems especially frustrated at the existence of the university. Lavender walks into the room and feels mixed feelings of jealousy and dislike of her due to her being born into privledge. Lavender is dressed in a fancy night gown and hugs the Mayor and shares a cup of coffee and tea with her. This rankles Scoria. Lavender begins to open books and treat the library with disregard. They seem to be content to be spend a quiet morning together. 

Scoria feels frustrated at the lack of greater revelations. This seems to just be a mayor who is not being good at being a mayor. The mayor leaves for a moment and Scoria sees Lavender jolt up and spread her fingers wide. She sits down and starts tracing the floor with her hands, and then naturally shifts back into her normal expression and rubs her eyes, and says "that is so fucking weird".  Scoria goes back to her house and runs into her mom and dad at home. 

While her mom is making a whole breakfast for everyone, Scoria goes to get bread and cheese for herself from the larder. Scoria confronts her mom about making breakfast for her as they converse about what Scoria was doing this morning. Scoria claims that she was learning a profession and her mom responds that they do not approve of the idea of professions and that all that she needs to do is get married. Scoria's mom tries to explain that she will not need a profession. Scoria goes off about how the lords of the mine just take advantage of the townsfolk and it is like slavery and that Scoria expresses a wish where the townsfolk just work for each other. Scoria's mother asks her what Scoria does for the town and explains that Scoria's dad works for the town by mining. 

Scoria's dad comes down, takes 90% of the breakfast and stares at Scoria for a long time. Dad tells Scoria that she is unlikely to make much of herself. Scoria retorts that what if I don't what if I just do my own thing. Scoria's dad responds back that Scoria is so full of anger and that how dare she go own way. Scoria desires to do interesting intersting things but her dad thinks that only interesting people (mine lords) do interesting things (make mines) and she will never be interesting. 

Scoria tries to convince her mom to stop doing everything for her dad because he controls her just as powerful people control him. After shedding a single tear her mother tells her that "There isn't a thing you do that isn't related to him". 

Scoria heads out to the woods. After a bit she feels the world shaking in a incredibly scary way and hears a loud crash from the direction of the mine. She takes off of running and sees the mine entrance collapsed and sees children crying and rumors of earthquake. It was around lunchtime so miners and miner's wives may be in the mine (definitely her parents). Scoria starts to  just start moving rocks futilely, as her hands bleed. Leroy starts to help fully believing this to be helpful. Gannister shows up and asks Scoria to stop so professionals can safely excavate the mine. Scoria protests and yells at Gannister for not helping. A large rock comes loose and hits her in the shoulder, breaking it. Leroy try to comfort Scoria. Gannister stops Scoria from continuing to dig through the catharsis so she doesn't hurt herself more, but says that he understands in a way.

Over the next few days people begin to actually excavate the mine. Scoria's need for information is never satsified as many townsfolk view it as just a thing that happens. A few rumors are around that the university is researching earthquakes. The conspiracy minded Scoria broods on this information for years. The mine collapse killed twenty-five miners and wives, including her parents.
