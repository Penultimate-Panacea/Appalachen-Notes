Welcome to the notes for the Appalachen Campaign!

## To Add Knowledge

1. First, make sure you have the free [Obsidian App](https://obsidian.md/) and some way of interacting with GitHub. The easiest way is to use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and login with your GitHub account. 
2. Fork this repository and sync to your computer with GitHub. 
3. Use the Open Folder as Vault feature in Obsidian to edit all of the notes. 
4. When you are done commit your changes and submit a pull request. As long as your changes don't break the part of the repository that makes the website work, I will accept the pull request and the changes will show up.
