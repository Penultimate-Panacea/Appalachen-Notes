# Steel City

A city of huge golden bridges that intersect each other forming more of a dome than a city. 
Magical education is highly important to surviving the steel city. Prohibition is affect. Whispers of rebellion live in the streets. 
Political life is drenched in corruption.
Exporting or importing beyond the walls is an opaque business.
