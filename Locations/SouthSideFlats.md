Dark, gloomy, perpetualyl not quite rainy or snowy. Sounds of industry and merchants everwhere. There are merchants everywhere, there is no seperation between housing and heavy industry. Mage hands are sending objects everywhere above me. Tons of cantrips being cast everywhere. Highly Eastern European, Russian, Slavic.
