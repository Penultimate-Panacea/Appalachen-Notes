# Session Two! 

Strange creatures emerge from the woods and three old women who look mishapen like old oaks emerge from the machine's entrance. One raises their umbrella to the sky and is calling down a bolt of lightening. 

Hayes pulls out a pair of stones that are their arcane focus and hexes the lightening bolt witch, [Sertha of the Looming Skies](Sertha.md). 

The university students start to rapidly flee into their own buildings and [Thaddeus](ThaddeusLagrangeskov) flees into a university building near by and finds it to be larger on the inside than it would appear on the outside and is around a hundred feet tall inside lined with books. Other university students are scared and fleeing inside. 

 Section 2

[Warvyn](WarvynBadaxe) left his battle axe at home and sneers at the 'things that shouldn't be there' and charges a snake like being which has two nubby feet at its front with two beady red eyes and groans against the ground and kicks the [bolder snake](BolderSnake.md).

[Sertha](Sertha) casts a spell which deafens the party and the other two witches cackle and enter into the [Water Being](WaterElementalSnake.md) that is in 

[Leroy](LeroyJenkins) screams 'For Meemaw' and reaches out with his new greataxe to strike [Sertha](Sertha) but absoluetly whiffs it, Sertha does not notice. 

Villagers run off screaming into the forest. [ThomasPilfrey](Non%20Player%20Characters/ThomasPilfrey.md) stands true and shouts for [Aurelia](AureliaDArcy) to flee the village and goes to fight a [fractal torando creature](FractalTornado.md). The [fractal](FracticalTorando) goes after Aurelia who has the tassles of her flapper dress torn off and is picked up thrown into an adjacent building. 

[Gannister](GannisterStoke) takes note for a moment of the size of the elementals and noticed how slowly and gentle the elementals were acting and shouts to the group unfortnuetatly most of the group is deafened but thankfully [Scoria](ScoriaCinderborn), [Harrison Hayes](Harrison%20Hayes.md), and Warvyn are aware. 

[Ayamar](Ayamar) attempts to reach out to the [Boulder](BolderSnake) through Awakened Mind and discovers that thinking part of the Boulder doesn't seem to be present and casts Expeditious Retreat on themeselves and starts to run out of town, right next to the Boulder. 

[Gannister](GannisterStoke) reaches for his gun and fires at Sertha doing some damage, spinning her around to focus on Gannister. 

[Auerlia](AureliaDArcy) notices that one of the witches, [Ethrel of the River Stones](Ethrel.md), has her eyes on the university building and has her arms raised and charms Ethrel who beautifuly and geneuinely smiles at Auerlia and provides Auerlia with a vew of the rows of sharpened teeth. It isn't that she is ugly but she is contorted in inhuman ways and asks Ethrel to come down and say hi. It has been a while since they caught up. 

[Scoria](ScoriaCinderborn) takes a shot at Sertha with their shortbow misses and ducks behind a building. 

Hayes misty steps to right next to a building and steps behind a nearby building and retreats into the trees behind the ring of village buildings and blasts the [Boulder Snake](BolderSnake) and splits some of the rocks in its tail. 

Inside the university building Thaddeus attempts to get information out of a crying to a twenty year old university student and it generally makes a mess of it. Thankfully the student provides a rough explaination of the purpose of the machine. The student provides a [ledger](SlimyPebbleLedger.md) that the mayor gave him. Thaddeus feeling bad for making of a mess of the scared student gives him a small heroin sucker.

Warvyn goes to flip the Boulder Snake after the tail was removed by Hayes. Unfortunely Warvyn only manages to shake it from behind screaming "I don't like this rock"  

Ethrel tells Auerlia that she needs to "Let out my little friends" before she can talk with her. A laminar flow of water reaches out to the university smashing the chimney causing the magic light bulbs to flicker a couple times and then stay on. 

Sertha casts a spell and causes acid rain to fall from the clouds stinging Leroy and begins to melt slowly melt Auerlia's parasol. Thankfully Ayamar is able to be out in the acidic downpour thanks to the many hats provided to them from [Rose Violet (aka Meemaw)](Rose%20Violet%20(aka%20Meemaw).md). 

Leroy has been slashing the air beneath Sertha for a while. But then, Leroy takes their battleaxe strikes Sertha! The ground glows green and saplings pull themselves out of the ground and point directly at Sertha. "Where the hell is my Meemaw!?" Sertha crouches down to put her weird twisted sunken eyes directly in line with Leroy's. Sertha flicks her long giraffe tounge as a small trickle of clear glassy (mineral oil like) blood starts to come from ankle. 

Thomas Pilfrey salutes Ayamar and draws his dagger and slices a small piece of the fractal tornado off but the dagger gets sucked into the tornado as a small piece of the tornado lands in his hands as he stands weaponless. 

Scoria goes to attack Sertha again but onces again misses their shot and noisely tries to hide in the building to escape both the gaze of Sertha and the acid rain pouring from the sky.

[Boulder Snake](BolderSnake) shuffles back on itself to crush Warvyn smashing him against the ground. 

The Fractal Tornado goes to strike Thomas but is off balance by the recent gash and misses its attack. 

Hayes is the only one who notices that the villagers are running into the forest and moments before they make it to the forest a circle appears in front of them as first their color is sucked into the circle then their outlines. The world is strangely silent save for the shouting of Leroy in the town center.

Ayamar's escape route is blocked by the Boulder Snake and feels a small twinge of guilt for leaving the screaming Leroy behind them and notices Sertha's descent and for the first time understands what evil may look like. Ayamar attempts to cast Dissonant Whispers against Sertha and causes Sertha flees from Ayamar providing an opening for Leroy and Scoria to make attacks and Scoria lands a hit. As Sertha flees she begins to lose her human like form as her form begins to melt away.

Gannister tries really hard to pummel [Cyprus of the Pining Shadows](Cyprus.md) but sadly none of his blows manage to connect. 

Aurelia asks for Ethrel to spend some time with her since they haven't met up in such a long time. Ethrel starts to descend and a small bit of loneliness washes over her face.
