The night gets darker as the clouds roll in. Dr. Lagrangeskov peeks out of the academy building and fires off his revolving rifle at Sertha but the shot does not connect. 

Hayes blasts the [Boulder Snake](BolderSnake) with a blast doing some significant damage. Hayes then ducks into the [Bakery](Pilfrey%20Bakery.md) and hears footsteps in the other room. 

Gannister shouts, "MeeMaw isn't here!", and grabs Leroy and pulls them into a nearby academic building. The magic caused by Leroy's axe fades as he is dragged away. While Gannister ducks deeper into the university's building Leroy stays in the doorway and again shouts at the witches "Where is my MeeMaw?!" Gannister pockets a few expensive tomes from the shelves as he proceeds down the spiral. 

Scoria peaks under the stage and sees tons of stakes holding the stage up sunk deep into the gravel and mud and pulls out their Crowbar! and Thief's Tools and examines how the stage was constructed. 

Leroy is screaming trying to figure out what is going on but his voice just bounces around the tower. He grabs a book off the shelf and throws it to the ground, The Prinicples of Arcane Engineering does not provide an answer for where MeeMaw went and so it is discarded. Gannister cautions the lad against damaging books so Leroy grips his axe tighter. 

Thomas pushes Aurelia aside and places himself in front of her and attempts to punch the Fractal Torando with no effect. 

Aurelia asks Ethrel to hang on a moment as she magic missles the Fractal Tornado which begins to unwind and appears significantly damaged. Aurelia back peddles to retreat from the elementals and witches continues to ask Ethrel to hang on a second. 

Ethrel follows Aurelia saying that it isn't a big deal, they can talk at home. Sethra darts out of the way once she sees Thaddeus's gun and calls down a great arc of electricty to the top of his building and it causes the lights in the university buildings to go out and Thaddeus, Gannister, and Leroy are left in the darkness. 

Thaddeus runs out of the building and rounds the corner chasing Sethra and swings at her but nothing connects. 

Hayes begins to make his way towards the living quarters of the bakery finds the mayor of Slimy Pebble cowering in fear. His eyes are glazed over and his clothing is tattered but doesn't look physically injured. He doesn't seem to notice Hayes enter the room until Hayes talks to him. The mayor starts to look around sort of randomly and doesn't appear to be able to percieve or understand Hayes. Hayes props a mattress up in front of the mayor to protect him and asks the mayor to keep his head down. The mayor makes a few small noises when the mattress touches him. Hayes ducks back behind the counter in the front of the store.

Gannister lights a hooded lantern and starts to flash the light around the darkened building and keeps heading towards the middle of the building. As he progresses into the building, the languages on the books become less common and the subject matter becomes more technical. 

Scoria peeks out from under the stage into the well where the portal which was once purple and shimmery but is now black and tumultous. As she raises the heavy red velvet of the stage cover and looks into the portal. It looks like you are looking into the bottom of a dark lake. Before the change, the purple space inside the portal was twisting and blocked sight after a turn but now in its black portal the inside looks more like a cone that narrows and narrows and narrows and narrows. Scoria drops a potato sized rock into the portal and sees the rock bounce off the sides of tunnel like it is full of syrupy water. Small chunks of the tunnel chip off as the rock bounces off of the sides. No sound emerges from the portal.

Leroy chases after Gannister and nags his uncle that the witches were destroying other buildings and that being 

"Before I come with you, what are you doing here? What are you and your sister's doing here, maybe I can help," Aurelia asks Ethrel. Ethrel responds, "Me and my sisters would love to have you be a part of our little cooperation. The village isn't of much use to us. If you want to come with us we can begin the real work." The real work involves resources of course. Ethrel is wearing ice armor and ice daggers that fluctuate with her voice. She reaches out both of her hands to Aurelia and says, "Let me show you."  
"Why don't you and your sister's DEPART and leave this paltry village alone." Auerlia suggests to Ethrel who gets on the janky Fractal Tornado's back awkwardly which retreats away. 

Sethra grabs the air and prepares to call lightening down when Hayes is able to fire off an Eldritch Blast which connects and interrupts her spell. Shocked and stunned Sethra stumbles back a few feet which provides an opening for Thaddeus to land a solid punch on Sethra and pulls her to the ground.  Thaddeus then proceeds to pummel Sertha with a series of powerful strikes. Thad asks what is going on and what was up with the Apple Harvest and Sertha responds that she would rather die.

Hayes Eldritch Blasts the Boulder Snake and its head cracks in half like an egg and it dies and then comes by Sertha and Thaddeus. 

Gannister continues into the middle of the building which has metal walls with a small table with a papers and books and a box with linen thrown over it. In the box is a 'not quite right' gun in the process of being constructed or deconstructed. This is a runic gun blade missing significant components. It doesn't have any bullets in it, the gun blade is arcanely and engineeringly focused. You do know that you need several gems to make the gun blade work, a corandium, and a pound of steel to make the required pieces to make the gun work. There is a book with translation and some notes on the table as well, Gannister slides the notes into the book and takes off with it.

Scoria pops out from under the stage and fires a shot at Cyprus and sneakily hits the witch in the water. Then Scoria pops back underneath the stage. 

Leroy starts running down the stairs and hears the thumping of machinery growing louder and more frequent before something sounds like it shatters. Leroy calls out for Gannister that something is here. 

Aurelia runs over to Hayes and Thaddeus and gets caught in the vines that Cyprus calls down which damage Auerlia, Hayes, and Thaddeus after she noticed that Sethra was damaged. 

Hayes and Thaddeus go to attack Sethra again and she is damaged but not dead 

As Gannister starts to run out of the university building he sees a bunch weird lights and a weird brain with arms is pulling towards him so he decides to GTFO and step of the winds out of the building and leaps out of the front door. 

Scoria fires off an arrow and squarely injures Cyprus. 

Aurelia untangles herself from the vines and ducks in the the building that Thaddeus was hiding in first. Here three more brains with arms and legs stare menacingly at Aurelia. 

Badaxe starts running to the general store to look for an axe. 

Sethra lashes out at Thaddeus and does severe damage, however this activates the fight club of part of his brain and the Thaddeus lays into Sethra, causing a crystal pop out of her mouth under the assault. As the crystal leaves her mouth she tries to swallow it as much as she can, failing to do so she makes one last attempt but then melts into sludge. Thaddeus grabs the crystal which feels cold and slimy and pops open his travelling salesman table, tosses the crystal inside, and then closes the table back up. The acid rain stops as the witch disolves. 

Hayes blasts Cyprus as she flees, 

Aurelia leaves the building and informs the rest of the party of the walking brains. 

Badaxe runs into the general store and finds it overwhelming with sights and sounds and smells. The store is full of equipment but sadly no large axe. Badaxe gets as much as they can carry of beer, three full cases, and grabs a pickaxe and a couple daggers.

The moss on Gannister's head is grown into his head, the moss on his head repelled the steel blade that Thaddeus was going to use to remove it. After putting some ammonia on to the moss turns it brown. Aurelia determines that it is magical and necromancy. Gannister demands that Thaddeus cuts it right off but Dr. Lagrangeskov refuses and explains that his brain is just below the moss. Gannister demands that some one cut it off and goes to find Badaxe. 

Scoria starts tossing more and more rocks and chairs and things into the big pit. More and more shards of the walls are falling apart. A rock comes back up out of the portal. So Scoria, starts stacking boards and putting stones on them so they can drop them all into the portal at once. 

The mayor has absconded and Hayes goes to cast Find Familiar to scout for people. 

Thomas is bleeding everywhere and Dr. Lagrangeskov sews him up and bandages his wounds and finds a spare set of clothes.
